I have a lot of plans with the NFL, including ELO ranking systems and machine learning models as well as in depth analysis as I go along.

<h4>NFL QB Ratings Example</h4>
<p>Here's an example of how my analysis ranks NFL quarterbacks by converting EPA per attempt during a match to an Elo rating. Tom Brady (Orange), Aaron Rodgers (Red), Patrick Mahomes (Blue), Brock Purder (Pink) are highlighted. Quarterback ratings are only updated if they played more than 10 snaps in the match.</p>

**Warning:** It should be noted that all initial ratings are set to 0 and there is a learning period before ratings become reliable - both when new QBs join the league as well as in the first few seasons of the plot.
